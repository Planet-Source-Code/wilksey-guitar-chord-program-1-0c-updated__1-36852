Guitar Chord Finder Program - ©2002 Wilksey!
=============================================
UPDATED! 13th July 2002!

Whats New?!?
-------------

Well, in the new 1.0c version, All the features of 1.0b Plus more!

For Open chord, change leave as 0, for Not played/muted, change to X

So, D:X:X:0:2:3:2:0 - Would be XX0232 not barred, or NPNP:O:2:3:2:Not Barre, NP=Not played, O=Open

Not played shows up as X, Open shows up as a empty string.

I havent added any Variation for the chords as yet, I will have to completely change the program
Which i just dont have the time to yet.
You will be pleased to know that I have a preliminary MIDI player set up!
So V2.0 Will have a basic MIDI implementation.

Also, I have included Frets up to 12 in this version, full Fret implementation will be in V2.0

I am not sure how far between releases will be, these have been pretty quick, because they required little
changing.

Also, I have added a few more chords, these are all the old ones updated to use Open and X plus:
C#, D#, G#, Db, Eb, Ab
Plus a new set of chords, #m, bm:
C#m, D#m, F#m, G#m, A#m, Dbm, Ebm, Gbm, Abm, Bbm

Whats NOT in this version:
--------------------------
*No MIDI Playback support for chords - Plans for a preliminary implementation in V2.0
*No Chord variations - No plans for this to be added yet!

Thank you for downloading my program
